    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        To make a homemade pizza, begin by preparing the dough. Mix flour, yeast, salt, sugar, and warm water, then knead the mixture into a smooth dough. Let the dough rise for about an hour. Once risen, roll it out into your desired pizza shape. Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F). Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, followed by shredded mozzarella cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add your favorite toppings such as pepperoni, vegetables, mushrooms, or olives. Bake the pizza in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove from the oven, slice, and enjoy your freshly made pizza!
