    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make a delicious burger, start by preparing the patty. 
        Mix ground beef with salt, pepper, and your preferred seasonings, 
        then shape the mixture into round patties. Heat a grill or pan over medium-high heat 
        and cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired doneness.
         While the patties are cooking, toast the burger buns in the oven or on the grill.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the patties are done, place them on the bottom bun, then add your toppings like cheese, 
        lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. Finish with your favorite sauces like ketchup, mayo, or mustard, 
        and place the top bun. Serve your homemade burger with a side of fries or salad, and enjoy!
